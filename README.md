The Color Game is an interactive and engaging game built using Python's Tkinter library. The objective of the game is to test players' ability to identify colors based on the text displayed on the screen, rather than the actual word itself. Players must type the name of the color that the text represents, while a countdown timer adds an element of urgency to the gameplay.

The game randomly selects colors from a predefined list, ensuring a varied experience each time.

2. Score Tracking: Players earn points for each correct color typed, with the score displayed in real-time.

3. Countdown Timer: A 30-second timer challenges players to score as many points as possible before time runs out.

4. User -Friendly Interface: The game features a simple and intuitive GUI, making it accessible for players of all ages.

• How to Play:

1. Press the "Enter" key to start the game.

2. Type the name of the color that corresponds to the text displayed (e.g., if the text is "Red" in blue color, type "Blue").
